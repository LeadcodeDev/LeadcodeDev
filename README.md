# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there !
My name is Baptiste, I've been a developer since 2016.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of challenging projects.

My journey in development began with a deep passion for the infinite capacity for creation whose only limit is that of the imagination. 
I've continually expanded my skills to keep up with the latest technological trends.

## What languages do I use ?
I use HTML, CSS, JS, Typescript and Dart, which form the solid foundation of my web development and application projects. 

With the constant evolution of web development, TypeScript has become a valuable addition to JavaScript. Its static typing offers greater security and easier maintenance of large projects, while improving the quality of my code.

Dart, for its part, is a language I'm exploring more and more, particularly for mobile application development with Flutter. In 
I'm developing the Mineral project in the same language

## What technologies and tools do I use?
I'm often asked what technologies I use in my various projects, both from a personal and professional point of view.

It's a question that always prompts careful consideration, as the choice of technologies is crucial to the success of a project. As far as web development is concerned, I often opt for modern frameworks such as Adonis for Typescript, Vue.js or React.js for the client side. 

These choices can be explained by the robustness, flexibility and active community that surrounds these technologies. In addition, the use of databases like PostgreSQL completes my web projects, offering efficient data management.
